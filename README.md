🚀 What I’m Building Right Now
1. CSU Mini-Pinball – “Operation Bounce Back”

A Python-based physics-lite arcade simulation built using turtle graphics.

Reinforces CS1301K fundamentals

Teaches loops, classes, collisions, events

Includes a full README + modular folder design

This project serves as a foundation for bigger game mechanics I’ll use later in my sci-fi tactical horror game.
